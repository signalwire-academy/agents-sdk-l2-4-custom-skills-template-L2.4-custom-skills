    Some checks didn't pass. Review the requirements and try again.

    **Tips:**
    - Make sure WeatherSkill inherits from SkillBase
    - Define SKILL_NAME and SKILL_DESCRIPTION
    - Use the @self.tool decorator in setup() to register functions
    - Import and add your skill in the agent with self.add_skill(WeatherSkill)
